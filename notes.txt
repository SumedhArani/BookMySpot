1) logo on topmost bar needs to be fixed

2) submission throttling currently uses malls.txt, needs to be dynamic as clients make changes

3) update "Parking Spot Booking" in both index.html and bookPage.html to client side login

4) - on bookPage.html, details that are reqd after clicking proceed need to match database
   - making proceed details page look nicer if possible

5) session of 300 seconds only during payment

6) integration with database - 
	i) client - mall owners - when they add or delete their mall
	ii) login and sign up
	iii) what else?
	
7) changing all files to follow conventions that our team has :P
